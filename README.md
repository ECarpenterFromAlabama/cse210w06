# Wizards Duel
Enjoy the tactical treat that is the Wizards Duel! In this paper-rock-sciscors-like game, battle your way throught the 4 mages to become the strongest mage possible. In the begining you can use each elemental spell 2 times each.

The options can be described as the following:
üî• Fire = Beats Ice, loses to Lightning
‚ùÑÔ∏è Ice = Beats Lightning, loses to Fire
‚ö° Lightning = Beats Fire, loses to Ice

Additionally, as your wizard "level's up" you gain more uses of each elemental spell. You also gain the following two spells as you level up:
üõ°Ô∏è Shield = Forces a tie(makes the opponent waste one use of their spells)
üíÄ Overkill = Wins against any offensive spell and is blocked by Shield
